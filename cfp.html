        <h2>Call For Papers</h2>
        <h3>8th International Conference on Movement and Computing: <br>June 22-25 2022, Chicago, Illinois, USA</h3>
        <h4><i>Final submission links and details will be posted September 2021.</i><h4>
        <h4><a href="https://moco22.movementcomputing.org/">Website: https://moco22.movementcomputing.org/</a></h4>
        <p>This Year’s Theme is Artificial Embodiment: Windy Shifts.  Wind chaotically rippling across the prairies of Illinois has a wildly different characteristic movement than the linear predictability of the Shift key on a computer keyboard.  Yet, both result in a transformation of the landscape, an opening of new possibilities.  Referencing the famed winds of the midwest where our conference event takes place alongside an oft used keyboard affordance through which many attendees may access the event, this theme highlights artificial systems that attempt to measure and recreate human-like physical intelligence.  We are curious about which  aspects of the moving human can and cannot be measured, as well as those that can and cannot be represented in artificial systems. For example, telepresence robots that attempt to give remote humans physical presence in work, social, or public physical spaces are a type of artificial embodiment that grapple with natural and artificial modalities of movement -- they are examples of  technologies that we may be shifting toward due to the prevailing winds of current events that necessitate interaction at a distance.</p>

        <h2>Submissions</h2>
        <p>MOCO is an interdisciplinary community where artistic and technical contributions are synergistic and equally valued.  We want to better understand how the full range of body movement interacts with computational technology.  Thus, we invite submissions that span many academic approaches, applied practices, and fields of study, unified by the concepts of movement and computing.  We encourage submitters to carefully articulate the relationship of their work to this lens through both scientific and artistic methods of inquiry.  Topics include, but are not limited to:</p>

        </ul>
        </ul>

      <p>In order to support our interdisciplinary community, MOCO is open to a wide range of ways to present your work. In addition to papers for oral and poster presentations, we invite submission of a wide range of practice work such as demos, performances, games, artistic works and movement workshops (in which participants take part in a guided movement activity). We encourage submitters to be creative in proposals for practice sessions and are open to novel formats.  The submission categories are:</p>

      <h2>Papers and Posters</h2>
      <ul>
<li>Long paper with oral presentation (8 pages maximum)</li>
<li>Short paper with oral presentation (4 pages maximum)</li>
<li>Extended abstract with poster presentation (6 pages maximum in the extended abstract format)</li>
</ul>

<p>The conference is an opportunity to present original research and details of collaborative work. Participants will have the chance to offer a presentation of the results of their research on one of the themes of the conference and to interact with their scientific/artistic peers in a friendly and constructive environment.</p>
<p>All submissions should be original and will be peer-reviewed by the MOCO community.</p>

        <h2>Practice Works</h2
<p>We deliberately use a very open term – “practice work” – to encourage diverse ideas of what practice in movement and computing is – and could be – and how such practice can be presented. We suggest the following as examples of what a practice work might be, but also stress that the list is not exhaustive and any types of presentation can be considered, the only criteria being excellence of the work. MOCO has limited means to present live work.  Accepted Practice Works that require significant resources, time, and/or space will need to be presented in alternative formats, e.g. video, structured discussion, or at independent or remote venues that can be made accessible to MOCO attendees.</p>
		<p>Suggested practice work formats:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Artworks</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Live performances</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Dance</li>
				<li>Music</li>
				<li>Theater</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Interactive Installations</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Projection art</li>
				<li>Movement tracking systems</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
		<li>Demos</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Games</li>
			<li>Technology demonstrations</li>
			<li>Video presentations</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Workshops</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Open-ended movement improvisations</li>
			<li>Movement choirs</li>
			<li>Physical practice sessions or tutorials</li>
		</ul>
		</ul>
		
		<p>Submissions consist of:</p>
		<ol>
<li>An extended abstract (2 pages minimum, 6 pages maximum).  This document will be published in the conference proceedings for accepted papers and should be a standalone description of the work.</li>
<li>Optional: Supporting media (videos, pictures, audio) that help explain the contribution of the work. </li>
<li>Optional: Detailed technical requirements and possible additional information. Accepted works will be required to fill out this information in a site-specific technical rider that will be emailed to authors following acceptance.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>All submissions should be original and will be peer-reviewed by the MOCO community.</p>
<p>Please note that we are an academic conference with a low registration fee, which means we cannot pay for commissioned performances and art work.</p>

		<h2>Doctoral Consortium</h2>
<p>The Doctoral Consortium is an opportunity for graduate students to present their work-in-progress on their advanced studies, especially their terminal degree, e.g., doctorate or MFA, to share and develop their research ideas in a supportive environment with the participation from  experts in the field. Students will have the opportunity to establish a community with other graduate students at a similar stage of their research. </p>
<p>Accepted students will give an oral presentation in a dedicated session. We encourage students to submit a description of their graduate work even if they are at an early stage. Videos and other supplementary materials are highly welcomed. Students accepted to present their work at the Doctoral Consortium must plan to attend it.</p>
			<p>Submissions consist of:</p>
		<ol>
<li>An extended abstract (400-800 words) describing the graduate work towards an advanced degree.  Accepted abstracts will be posted in the conference program.</li>
<li>Optional: Supporting media (videos, pictures, audio) that help explain the contribution of the work. </li>
		</ol>
